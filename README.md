# Scrapping Dataset from Atlas Obscura

**Dataset**: You'll find a CSV file (`dataset.csv`) in this repository, containing the data obtained through web scraping from Atlas Obscura. This dataset provides valuable information for our analysis.

- **Dictionaries**: We've included the word-to-id and inverted index dictionaries that are essential for our text analysis. These files are named `word_to_id_dictionary.txt` and `inverted_index_dictionary.txt`.

- **Ranking List**: To assist in interpreting the results of our theoretical questions, we've created a ranking list, available in the file `ranking_list.txt`.
  
- **CommandLine.sh**: This is an executables bash shell script file contains the script to answer to the command line question.

  **Questions**: This is a file that whitin has a link to the repository that has the questions.
